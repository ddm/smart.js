Mongoose Cloud is an independent component of Mongoose IoT Platform.
It provides authentication, access control, device registry, database,
dashboards, events, notifications services. It supports HTTP (RESTful),
MQTT and WebSocket protocols.

Start using Mongoose Cloud by
[creating a user account](http://cloud.mongoose-iot.com). After account
is created, you can register devices - either by using a web UI,
or by using `miot register` command.

Devices can send events and data to the Cloud using simple RESTful
interface, which is documented at http://cloud.mongoose-iot.com/#tab=api
